# Computer Science Office Hour Hub - COMP 494

The project chosen for this semester is to develop a web application using React App.

## Description
The purpose of this web application is to provide students of the computer science department a simple and stress-free way to schedule for office hours with their desired teacher/ TA, receive reminders so they donâ€™t forget, and increase the chances of them actually getting the help they need.

## Project Duration
This project took place from Januray 2021 to May 2021, or for the entirety of the Spring 2021 semester.

## Goals
* Develop a deeper understanding of web development
* Develop my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills
* Learn about React, a popular tool and library used for web development
* Gain an understanding of the foundations of UI design

## Reflections
  This project was a bit more difficult than I had orginally anticipated. Considering that my coursework this semester required me to code in C++, it was quite difficult to learn Javascript (more specifically JSX) at the same time.
  I learned about designing responsive web pages. I also learned about different ways to organizes divs in CSS. I learned some extra tips and tricks about selectors in CSS as well. 
  If I could do this project again, I definitely would do some more research about other frameworks and softwares. I think it would have used Flutter instead. Flutter applications can be written in Dart and C++, and I would have also been able to easily turn my web app into a mobile app as well. I also think that I would be able to develop the app fully, assuming that I would have been able to program faster using C++.
  In the end, while the finished product is not what I expected, I still beleive that this was a rewording experience. I am excited about possibly having a career as a frontend developer.
